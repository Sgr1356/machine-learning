Multi Linear Regression -  FInding out the best fit plane
multiple independent variable but single output

by using formula 1st you find the multi linear regression plane and then after you have to 
reduce the submission then you find then best fit plane

Gradient Decent is an optimaization algo which find you the best fit line in minimal number of iterration


   # corelation is a matrix whic is used to see relation between two variables 
   # range of correlation is  between -1 to 1
   # a variable is said to be highly corelated with one more variable if its corealtion value to 1 or -1 
   # corelation is Relation between nummerics if we want to then convert to encoded values
