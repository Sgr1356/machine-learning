logistic regressionn is used for binary type of algorithm 0 or 1, yes or no,high or low

logistic regression uses sigmoit function

range 0-1

if value is greater then0.5 then consider 1 and lower than consider 0

when we apply sigmoid function onn linear regression eq y=mx+c
you will getting logistic regression



Note:  Standard scaling is mandatory if we are going to apply data on  algo which is releated to Distance calculation
